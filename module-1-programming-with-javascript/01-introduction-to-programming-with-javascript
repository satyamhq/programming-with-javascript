# Introduction to Programming with JavaScript

## Overview

JavaScript powers much of the interactivity you experience online every day, including search engines, online shopping, social media, drop-down menus, and autocomplete features. It is widely known as the **programming language of the web**, but its capabilities extend far beyond front-end development.

Today, JavaScript is used for:

* Front-end development
* Back-end development
* Mobile application development (with React)

Because of its versatility and importance, understanding JavaScript is essential for modern software development.
