# Introduction to Programming

## Overview

Programming plays a critical role in the modern world. Almost every daily activity—from shopping and exercising to communicating online—relies on computer programs. Programming is simply the process of giving computers a set of instructions to follow in order to perform specific tasks.

## What Is Programming?

* Programming means **writing instructions** for a computer
* These instructions tell the computer what to do under specific conditions
* Instructions are written using **programming languages**

A **computer program** is a sequence of steps designed to complete a task.

## Programming in Everyday Life (Jane’s Example)

### Grocery Shopping

* Barcode scanner reads product information
* A program retrieves prices for each item
* Cash register software:

  * Adds prices
  * Calculates tax and discounts
  * Prints a receipt
* Payment system contacts banking software to process the transaction

---

### Fitness Tracking

* Smartwatch tracks heart rate
* Data syncs with a fitness application
* User controls what information is shared and who can see it

---

### Online Shopping

* Ordering flowers online involves many programs
* Systems communicate over networks
* May include telecommunications systems and satellites

---

## Software and Hardware

* **Software**: Programs that perform tasks
* **Hardware**: Physical machines that run software

All programs run on hardware devices such as computers, servers, and smart devices.

---

## Programming Languages

Programming languages are used to communicate instructions from humans to computers.

### Purpose of Programming Languages

* Act as a bridge between people and computers
* Allow humans to write instructions in readable form
* Are translated into a form computers understand

---

## Machine Language and Binary Code

* Computers store and process instructions in **binary code**
* Binary code consists of **0s and 1s**
* Binary represents electrical signals in hardware

### Key Components

* **RAM**: Stores programs and data temporarily
* **Disk**: Stores programs permanently
* **CPU**: Processes binary instructions

Machine language is considered a **low-level language** because it is close to the hardware.

---

## High-Level vs Low-Level Languages

### Low-Level Languages

* Binary and machine code
* Directly understood by the CPU
* Difficult for humans to read and write

### High-Level Languages

* Examples: JavaScript
* Easier for humans to understand
* Must be **interpreted or compiled** into binary code

High-level languages help developers communicate with the CPU without dealing directly with binary instructions.

---

## Why Programming Matters

* Computer programs are everywhere
* Programming powers modern technology
* Enables innovation across industries

---

## Key Takeaways

* Programming is giving computers instructions
* Programs run on hardware and are called software
* Programming languages bridge humans and machines
* Computers understand binary, not human language
* High-level languages like JavaScript make programming accessible

Programming is a powerful and exciting field that impacts nearly every aspect of modern life. By learning to program, you are beginning your journey as a developer in the digital world.
